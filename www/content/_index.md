  subheader: Non-profit Open Genome Research
  intro: |-
    The Personal Genome Project UK provides open genome, trait, and health data. Sharing data is critical to scientific progress, but has been hampered by traditional research practices.

    Our approach is to invite willing participants to openly share their personal genome data for the greater good.

      medicine and provide a resource for advancing research. This is why PGP-UK advocates
      for openly sharing potentially identifiable data.
