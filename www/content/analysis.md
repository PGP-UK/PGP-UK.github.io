  PGP-UK genomes are analysed for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the context of ancestry, health and traits. SNVs are changes in the DNA sequence. The result of this analysis is sumarised in the Genome Report, available on the Data page.

  The genomes are also analysed for epigenetic variants (in DNA mehtylation) in the context of age, and environmental exposures. Epigentic variants are chemical changes to the DNA, which alter how it is used without changing the DNA sequence. The result od this analysis is summarised in the Methylome Report, available on the Data page.
