My hair used to be very straight, to an extent that I got a perm done when I was about 15 but this resulted in sheep-like frizzy mini-curls. Since then my hair is naturally curly, with nice corkscrew curls when air-dried, but frizzy if overbrushed. My hair is fine, as opposed to the much coarser hair of my mother and sister."
